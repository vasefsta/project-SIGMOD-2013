General Information:

- We decided to organize the code in five directories. 
  - programs : Containing the main function of program.
  - modules &nbsp; : Containing all functions needed by modules to work properly.
  - include &nbsp; &nbsp; : Containing all header files needed by source code.
  - tests &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : Containing the test functions to prove that every module works flawless.
  - misc &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : Containing all "sub functions" needed by program.
    




Notes: 
- With list_test both ADTLinkedList and ADTEntryList are being checked.
- lookup_entry_word can check only one word at a time so we call this function for every word in a Document.
